You are a developer for a university. Your current project is to develop a system for students to find courses they share with friends. The university has a system for querying courses students are enrolled in, returned as a list of (ID, course) pairs.  Write a function that takes in a collection of (student ID number, course name) pairs and returns, for every pair of students, a collection of all courses they share.
